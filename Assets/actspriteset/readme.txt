Thanks for your purchase.


"Retro act sprite set" is suitale for low resolution retro style action games.(platformer,sidescroller)
Each sprite was drawn by only 4 colors.(like a game of old portable machine)


In this asset,player character size is nearly 16x16 pixels (width x height).
(some sprites are a little bigger than this)


"pl.png" is a sprite sheet of player character.

"ene.png" is a sprite sheet of enemies and stage gimicks.

"spritefont(1-5) .png" are sprite sheets of fonts and words.

"sp.png" is a sprite sheet of basic sprite for action game. 
(effect, fire, breakable blocks, item boxes, food, coins, life gauge icons, bullet , and more)

"tl.png" is a sprite sheet of tiles for constructing each level.



In "document" folder , there are some pictures for explanation of each sprite.(These pictures are not sprite sheet.)





This asset is relation with the following asset.

-"Retro Sprite Font and Icons" asset.(this asset is free)




I will create another asset for retro style action game(tileset, enemy sprite set, another player sprite).
So check my another asset in unity asset store if you like.




<caution> 

1. about pixels per unit(PPU)


In this asset , default pixels per unit(PPU) of each spritesheet is 15.9 .

If you have pixel perfect script (for camera and for each object) ,you had better change PPU from 15.9 to 16 before you begin constructing each level.



2.about true color

Parency bug occurs in current version of unity when you use png image in [16bit] setting,so use png image in [true color] setting. 
(default setting of this asset is "true color")





<version history>

1.05    fixed pixel bug (in "ene.png", transparency bug of ene115-119,and ene204 sprite were fixed)
